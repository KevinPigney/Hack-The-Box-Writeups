# Hack The Box – DFIR Write-ups

This repository contains my ongoing collection of Hack The Box Sherlock investigation notes, focused on digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) rather than step-by-step challenge completion.

Over the past few months, I've been completing Sherlocks and taking structured notes while treating each scenario as a real-world investigation. My emphasis is on:
- Developing investigative methodology
- Becoming familiar with Windows artifacts
- Practicing analysis using a wide variety of DFIR tools
- Documenting my reasoning and decision-making throughout each case

These write-ups are not intended to be "how-to" guides or direct solutions. Instead, they reflect how I think through problems, pivot between tools, validate findings, and build conclusions during an investigation.

I've just recently begun publishing these notes publicly and intend to continue adding Sherlock write-ups here as I complete them. The level of detail may vary and may not be as comprehensive as official HTB walkthroughs, but the goal is transparency in my critical thinking, problem-solving, and investigative flow.

This repository primarily serves as:
- A personal knowledge base I can reference anywhere
- A way to share my DFIR learning process publicly
- A resource for others working through HTB challenges or learning incident response concepts
